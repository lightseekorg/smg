//! Prometheus metrics for the priority scheduler.
//!
//! Split to match design §9: this module holds the **operational** counters
//! and the queue-wait histogram (recorded on the admission / queue paths),
//! plus the **capacity / autoscaling** gauge setters. The gauges are
//! point-in-time state (inflight, queue depth, utilization, capacity
//! pressure) refreshed by the scheduler's sampler task, so the hot
//! admission path only does cheap counter increments.
//!
//! All names carry the `smg_` prefix to match the rest of the gateway's
//! metrics. Class/outcome labels are `&'static str` (no per-request
//! allocation).
