//! `td:` stream adapter: gateway ↔ mesh bridge for the distributed
//! prefix tree.
//!
//! - Outbound: `on_local_insert` buffers per-model `TreeDelta`s;
//!   the drain callback batches each model into one
//!   `td:{model_id}` stream entry per gossip round.
//! - Inbound: a spawned task subscribes to `td:`, decodes each
//!   batch, and hands every delta to [`TreeHandle`] which either
//!   applies it (the matched prefix is already known locally and
//!   the worker becomes a tenant of that node) or returns false.
//!   On false, the adapter publishes a `tree:req:` repair request
//!   targeted at a random ALIVE peer; the response (`tree:page:`)
//!   is consumed in a later slice.
//!
//! The adapter holds no tree-membership state. The tree owner
//! (`CacheAwarePolicy` in production) implements [`TreeHandle`];
//! dependency direction is adapter → policy. Membership lookups
//! likewise go through a [`PeerList`] trait so the adapter doesn't
//! reach into the gossip controller directly.
